# Open Leadership Training Series
How to work openly to build collaboratively

This Open Leadership Training Series teaches you best practices in “working open” -- a way of working where:

* **_everyone_ is invited to collaborate on something amazing,**
* **and any new product or knowledge is shared widely and freely.**

This is for anyone starting up or leading open projects-- project leads, collaborators, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.
