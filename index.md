This Open Leadership Training Series is designed to teach you best practices in  “working open” -- a way of working in which:

* **a community of people collaborate to make or build something amazing,**
* **and any product or knowledge that the community of collaborators creates is shared widely and freely with the public on the world wide web.**

This is for anyone starting up or currently leading open projects-- project leads, partners, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.
